Sasquatch uses the Kafka Connect framework for integrting data between Kafka and other systems.

Kafka Connect provides a scalable and fault-tolerant way to move data in and out of Kafka, without requiring custom code or complex configuration.

The :ref:`influxdbsink` is a Kafka connector that allows data to be written from Kafka topics to InfluxDB.
